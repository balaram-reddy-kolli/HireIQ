# HR Prompt Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented HR prompt integration that allows recruiters to provide custom instructions when adding candidates. These instructions are then used by the AI interviewer to generate targeted questions based on the recruiter's specific requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Updates (`RecruiterDashboard.tsx`)
- âœ… Added `hrPrompt` state variable to manage HR prompt input
- âœ… Updated candidate creation form to include HR prompt textarea
- âœ… Modified `addCandidate` function to send HR prompt to backend
- âœ… Added HR prompt field to TypeScript `Candidate` interface
- âœ… Updated form layout to be more user-friendly with proper labeling
- âœ… Added help text explaining the purpose of HR instructions

**UI Changes:**
- HR prompt input is optional and appears below email input
- 3-row textarea with helpful placeholder text
- Clear explanation of how HR instructions guide the AI interviewer

### 2. Backend Updates

#### Models (`candidates/models.py`)
- âœ… `hr_prompt` field already existed in Candidate model (StringField)

#### Serializers (`candidates/serializers.py`)
- âœ… Added `hr_prompt` field to `CandidateCreateSerializer` (required=False, allow_blank=True)
- âœ… Added `hr_prompt` field to main `CandidateSerializer` for API responses
- âœ… Updated `to_representation` method to include hr_prompt in API responses

#### Views (`candidates/views.py`)
- âœ… Updated `auto_generate_questions` function to use stored HR prompt
- âœ… Modified logic to preserve recruiter-provided HR prompt instead of overwriting
- âœ… Fallback to default Google SDE instructions when no HR prompt provided

#### Questions Module (`candidates/ml_models/questions.py`)
- âœ… Already supports HR prompt parameter in `get_questions` function
- âœ… `merge_hr_with_hot_topics` function processes HR instructions properly
- âœ… HR prompt is used to categorize topics and generate targeted questions

## Workflow

### Current Implementation Flow:
1. **Recruiter adds candidate:**
   - Enters candidate email
   - Optionally provides HR prompt with specific instructions
   - Submits form

2. **Backend processes:**
   - Creates candidate record with stored HR prompt
   - Sends email notification to candidate with ID

3. **Candidate starts interview:**
   - Uploads resume
   - Clicks "Start Interview"
   - System calls `auto_generate_questions` endpoint

4. **Question generation:**
   - Uses stored HR prompt (if provided) or default Google SDE instructions
   - Generates questions using `questions.py` with HR prompt as input
   - Returns customized questions based on recruiter's requirements

## Technical Details

### API Changes
- `POST /api/candidates/` now accepts optional `hr_prompt` field
- `GET /api/candidates/` returns `hr_prompt` field in candidate data
- `POST /api/candidates/auto-generate-questions/` uses stored HR prompt

### Database Schema
- `hr_prompt` field in Candidate model stores recruiter instructions
- Field is optional and can be blank
- Preserved across candidate lifecycle

### Question Generation Integration
- HR prompt is passed to `get_questions(resume_file, HR_prompt, company, role)`
- `merge_hr_with_hot_topics(hr_prompt, hot_topics)` processes instructions
- AI interviewer generates questions based on specific requirements

## Testing Verification

### âœ… Completed Tests:
- Frontend UI displays HR prompt input correctly
- Backend endpoints are accessible and properly structured
- API payload includes hr_prompt field
- Integration test confirms workflow structure

### ðŸ§ª Manual Testing Steps:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in as recruiter with Google OAuth
3. Add new candidate with custom HR prompt
4. Verify candidate creation succeeds
5. Check that HR prompt is stored and used for question generation

## Benefits

### For Recruiters:
- **Customizable interviews:** Tailor questions to specific role requirements
- **Company-specific focus:** Add instructions for startup vs enterprise environments
- **Skill targeting:** Focus on particular technologies or competencies
- **Cultural fit assessment:** Include company values and culture considerations

### For Candidates:
- **Relevant questions:** Receive questions aligned with actual role requirements
- **Better preparation:** Questions match the specific position applied for
- **Fair assessment:** Evaluated on skills relevant to the actual job

## Example HR Prompts:

```
Frontend Focus:
"Focus on React, TypeScript, CSS, and modern frontend development practices. 
Include questions about component architecture, state management, and responsive design."

Backend Focus:
"Emphasize Django, Python, database design, and API development. 
Ask about scalability, security practices, and microservices architecture."

Full-Stack Startup:
"Test both frontend and backend skills with emphasis on rapid development, 
problem-solving, and ability to work across the entire tech stack in a fast-paced environment."
```

## Future Enhancements:
- Add HR prompt templates for common roles
- Allow editing HR prompt after candidate creation
- Display HR prompt preview in candidate list
- Analytics on question effectiveness by HR prompt type
